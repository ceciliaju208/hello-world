# hello-world
This is a place to experiment and test functionalities of Github, including, but not limited to readme, pull and push requests and branching/forking out. 

# Branching
- Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at the same time.
- When you create a branch, it makes a copy of the Master, and you can commit changes, submit a pull request, open up for discussion and changes, and then merge feature branch into Master when you feel that the code is ready for production.
